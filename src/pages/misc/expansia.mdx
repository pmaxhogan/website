## Software Engineer II, Dec 2021 - Present

At [EXPANSIA Group, Inc.](https://expansiagroup.com/), I'm a Software Engineer II working on a couple of full-stack sites.

Since joining in December 2021, I've improved performance of
data ingest pipeline by 5x, refactored technical debt out of a legacy web app into a modern application, and created an
internal automation tool. As part of my work to remediate numerous security findings in our application, I architected and deployed a new
microservice to scan user-generated content for malware, helping us achieve [DISA STIG](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) compliance.

I was initially hired as a temporary contractor to prepare an application for a big demo. EXPANSIA won a big contract as a result of the success of that demo, and I've been working there since then.

I've successfully worked on multiple teams using Agile methodologies, including all aspects of the software development lifecycle: from architecture diagramming and product planning, to development, unit testing, code review, deployment, and support. I've built and modified pages and components referencing design mockups, and
implemented new backend microservices to support new features. When needed, I've delivered last-minute features to meet deadlines and ensure customer satisfaction.

I strongly believe in software quality, and I led a big push to increase test coverage in the project following defects

I've gained further experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure, and
philosophies like microservices and cloud computing. I've also worked with SQL, GraphQL, Protobuf, gRPC, and Vue.js. I'm
responsible for several major refactors of growing projects, and initiated the effort to add much-needed unit testing to
the frontend codebase.
