## Software Engineer, Dec 2021 - Present

At [EXPANSIA Group, Inc.](https://expansiagroup.com/), I'm architecting a full-stack Big Data web solution to select,
analyze, and track 3D-printed parts for the Department of Defense. While working there, I've improved performance of
data ingest pipeline by 5x, refactored technical debt out of a legacy web app into a modern application, and created an
internal automation tool.

I've successfully worked on multiple teams using Agile methodologies, participated in code reviews, and
reached out to others when I got stuck. I've built and modified pages and components referencing design mockups, and
implemented new backend microservices to support new features. I delivered last-minute features to meet a deadline,
resulting in a very well received demo to the client.

I've gained further experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure, and
philosophies like microservices and cloud computing.
