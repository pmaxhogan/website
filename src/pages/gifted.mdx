I am the primary back-end software engineer for an advanced gift recommendation app called [Gifted](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1218940703). Through the Amazon affiliate program, I've developed an algorithm that gives users gift recommendations via a Neo4j database. A REST API written in Nodejs using express provides the iOS app with recommendations from the database. Gifted runs on autoscaling AWS EC2 instances deployed with AWS elastic beanstalk. Gifted will be released on the iOS app store in Summer 2020.
