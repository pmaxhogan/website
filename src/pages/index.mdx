I'm Max! This is a collection of various projects I've worked on over the years.

## Web apps
<ProjectList list={props.data.allMdx.edges} filter="web" />


I've built [Gifted](/gifted), some [web apps](/web-apps/), some [cli apps](/cli-apps/), [some simple games](/games/), and [some other things](/misc).

export const pageQuery = graphql`
query {
allMdx {
edges {
node {
id
frontmatter {
tags
title
summary
}
slug
}
}
}
}
`
