On February of 2023, [I earned](https://www.credly.com/badges/eeb5d1f4-d326-414f-a594-932b74ad5889/public_url) the information security certificate [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security), which represents my significant knowledge in personal, enterprise, application, and cloud security.

According to [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security), this verifies my ability to:
> - Assess the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions.
> - Monitor and secure hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology.
> - Operate with an awareness of applicable regulations and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance.
> - Identify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents.

I don't work in information security specifically, but I believe a strong knowledge of information security principles is critical to modern
 software engineering, [especially for the web](/#web).
