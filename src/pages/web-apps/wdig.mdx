[Where Does It Go?](https://wdig.ml) lets you find out where a URL goes without actually going there. It runs a real web browser and shows you everywhere it goes, including a screenshot of the final destination. It also warns you if the final destination is a rickroll or flagged as unsafe by [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/).

WDIG is build with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), is hosted on Firebase Hosting & Functions and is open source [on Github](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/wdig).
