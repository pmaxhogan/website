[Create Tier List](https://createtierlist.web.app/) lets you create a "tier list" of any thing you want! Chose from a preset or add your own items. Use the default tiers, or create your own! Share a link to your tier list with someone else (or don't, I don't care).  

It uses Vue.js & Vuetify, is hosted with Firebase Hosting, and is available [on Github](https://github.com/pmaxhogan/createtierlist).
