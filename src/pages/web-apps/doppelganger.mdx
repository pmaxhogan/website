Doppelganger.tk is a [site](https://doppelganger.tk) and an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.doppelganger) that lets you check whether a username is taken across a variety of sites. You can filter for found or not found sites, sort by popularity, filter for a specific site, or only show results for sites you've favorited. It also suggests alternate / past usernames that could be claimed. Username info is cached with a lifetime of 5 hours, so any changes could take up to 5 hours to update.
