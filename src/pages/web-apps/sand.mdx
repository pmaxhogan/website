summary: "Sand uses device orientation sensors to slide small squares across the screen."
---

[Sand](https://mobile-sand-demo.web.app/) uses the [`deviceorientation` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent) to slide small squares across the screen drawn on an HTML `<canvas>` based on the orientation of your mobile device. It simulates gravitational acceleration, friction and some randomness for a realistic sliding effect that creates very neat visual patterns. It is hosted with Firebase Hosting and its source code is available [on Github](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/sand).
