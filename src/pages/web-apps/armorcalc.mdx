[Minecraft Armor Calculator](https://armorcalc.tk/) lets you calculate various stats for a Minecraft armor set. You can calculate armor points and toughness, EPFs, how much damage you'll take in certain situations, and if an enchantment is wasted.

It uses Vue.js v3, is hosted with Firebase Hosting, and is available [on Github](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/minecraft-armor-calculator).
