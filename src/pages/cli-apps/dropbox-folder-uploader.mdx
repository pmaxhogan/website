I needed a way to upload a massive folder to Dropbox from a Linux command-line, so I made [`dropbox-folder-uploader`](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/dropbox-folder-uploader). It is written in Node.js and uses [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to recursively upload a folder to Dropbox with a given API token.
