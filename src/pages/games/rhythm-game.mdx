I used [rust-sfml](https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-sfml) to create a simple rhythm game that can load StepMania (.sm) files. If you're unfamiliar with rhythm games, think of Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, etc. Essentially, the player has to hit an arrow key in time with "notes" that appear on the screen.
