Pixel Bomber is a simplistic browser-based multiplayer game that lets you battle anyone anywhere for the leaderboard. Move around the map, shoot and place bombs to eliminate other players! [Play it now!](http://pixel.programmer5000.com)  

[Pixel Bomber's client side code](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/bomb-game-frontend) is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for (optional) user authentication for persistent username storage and claiming. The client connects to a WebSocket and receives map and user data, and then provides it with updates to movement and controls.  


[Pixel Bomber's server side code](https://github.com/realprogrammer5000/bomb-game) is hosted on Heroku. Game physics, player interaction, etc. are all done on the server side to ensure clients are honest.
