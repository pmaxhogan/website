### Who am I?
Hi! I'm Max Hogan, and I'm a rising senior at [Souhegan High School](https://www.sau39.org/shs).  
  
**What can I do for you?**

### Solutions
#### Custom Web App Development
I specialize in client and server-side development of web and mobile apps like [Gifted](/gifted), [WDIG](/web-apps/wdig), [Doppelganger.tk](/web-apps/doppelganger), [Blar.tk](/web-apps/blar) and [Vote Cats](/web-apps/votecats).

#### Data and Web Automation
Find yourself spending lots of time on simple, tedious tasks online? I'm experienced in data manipulation, web scraping and other web automation techniques. 

#### Chrome Extension Development
Want to change the behavior or functionality of a website or Chrome itself? Whether you want to change something for yourself, help your brand engage with customers, or even create and distribute a product to customers, I can help.

#### Website Performance Optimization
[Google penalizes slow sites in search rankings.](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html) Are you losing customers to a slow site? I can help. I optimized the performance of a website for a client, taking the [PageSpeed score](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about#score) from 53 to 81 and resulting in a much better page loading experience. Let me see what I can do for your site.

#### Company GSuite Deployment
Get Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drive for your business and a professional email @yourcompany.com with [GSuite for business](https://gsuite.google.com/). Engage customers with email on your domain and use the same Gmail interface you use on your personal email. Get email forwards like support@yourcompany.com. I can set up and deploy GSuite on your website, and even migrate your existing emails and users (without email downtime) if you already have company email set up. 


#### Computer Technical Assistance
Is your computer slow? Behaving mysteriously? Need general technical help? I can help you remotely.
